        This will be the description of the block I need to go outside of my
        comfort zone right now to exist myself as a developer and as a male .
        What a tragedy for me as a poor student who is lost his goals in his
        life in his mid life and waste his whole youth in some silly addiction
        and anxiety problem from family security...
      </p>
    </div>
